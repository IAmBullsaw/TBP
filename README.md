# TBP
The Traveling Beersman Problem is a problem posed by a friend of mine who wanted to find out the shortest path between pubs during a pub crawl with changing starting points.

This is a simple script for solving this problem.

## The input
Running the script, user is prompted to insert five pubs. It's between these the TBP emerges.

There needs to be a file containing all the pubs questioned.

This is named pubs.txt

This file is loaded for all TBP problems and is laid out like so:
    me pub1 distance
    me pub2 distance
    pub1 pub2 distance

## The output
It's really the first, shortest match that is printed.
